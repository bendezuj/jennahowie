      <h2>Dear Jen Jen ...</h2>
      <p> You are probably a little confused as to why I made you go to this website, well I as you can tell you have some new socks for you :) I bought them because they reminded me of how cool, fun, and amazing you are and since you are my best friend and my homie, I thought about you when I saw them, they reminded me of you my love. I hope you like them!! </p>
      <p> 2.24.21 Dear Jenna, after some struggle from your end you finally were able to find the link to the website. Good job butterfly! I didn't get you sunflowers because this time I wanted to pick something that reminded me how colorful your soul is in my life and also did some changes here :) This has been a pretty gray and white winter and you have brought so much color to it. I love every second with you and I hope you can one day see what I see when I look at you. Love you my precious, lovely, squooshy, butterfly penguin panda girl ❤️ </p>
